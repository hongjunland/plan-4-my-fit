-- Seed data for development and testing

-- Insert sample muscle groups data (for reference)
-- This is just for documentation - actual muscle groups are handled in the application

-- Sample exercise library data (for reference)
-- These would typically be stored in a separate exercises table in production
-- For MVP, we'll handle this in the application code

-- Sample routine templates (for reference)
-- These could be used as default templates for AI generation

-- Note: In production, you would typically have:
-- 1. An exercises table with a comprehensive exercise library
-- 2. A muscle_groups table with standardized muscle group definitions
-- 3. Template routines for different fitness levels and goals
-- 4. Equipment requirements for each exercise

-- For MVP, we're keeping it simple and handling exercise data in the application code
-- The AI will generate exercises based on user preferences and requirements

-- Example of what seed data might look like:
/*
INSERT INTO exercises (name, muscle_group, equipment, difficulty_level) VALUES
('Push-ups', 'chest', 'bodyweight', 'beginner'),
('Bench Press', 'chest', 'barbell', 'intermediate'),
('Squats', 'legs', 'bodyweight', 'beginner'),
('Deadlifts', 'legs', 'barbell', 'advanced');
*/

-- For now, we'll rely on the AI to generate appropriate exercises
-- based on user profile and preferences
